# Capture The Flag (CTF)
## About
This is an equivalent of lab 8-10. 
Students have to form a group of 4 to create a security challenge and other groups have to decrypt these challenges and find the flag.
Students are given 1 week to solve a total of 8/10 challenges, in order to get the full 4%. (aka each challenge solved is 0.5%).
* Hints will be given from the middle of the week onwards.

Our group is _Reverse Gnireenigne (RE)_. We have managed to solve 6/10 challenges. The 'Challenges Final Write Up' contains our solutions
to the challenges we have solved. 

Group members:
1. Balan Vidya Abinaya
2. Glenn Chia Jin Wee
3. Kenneth Soon Wei Yuan
4. Sumedha Gn
